# Decisions Journal

One line per non-trivial technical decision: date — decision — why.

## Phase 1

- 2026-06-12 — Stack pinned by scaffold: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript strict. — Latest `create-next-app` defaults; matches the fixed stack in CLAUDE.md.
- 2026-06-12 — Enabled `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `noImplicitOverride` on top of `strict`. — Domain layer does array/index math (FEFO, demand windows); forcing undefined-checks at indices prevents a whole class of bugs and raises the code-quality bar.
- 2026-06-12 — Dark mode via class-based `@custom-variant dark` + a pre-paint inline script reading `localStorage`/`prefers-color-scheme`. — SPEC §4 wants system default + manual toggle without a flash of the wrong theme; Tailwind v4 defaults to media-query dark mode which can't be toggled.
- 2026-06-12 — Secret server key stored under env name `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` even though the value is a new-format `sb_secret_…` key. — Keeps code/docs consistent with CLAUDE.md/SPEC naming; the new secret key fills the same server-only role.
- 2026-06-12 — `vitest` configured with `passWithNoTests: true` and 95% coverage thresholds scoped to `src/lib/domain/**`. — Lets the gate pass before Step 3 lands tests, while enforcing SPEC §7's ≥95% domain coverage once they exist.
- 2026-06-12 — `tsx` chosen to run `scripts/seed.ts` via `npm run seed`. — Zero-config TypeScript execution for a Node script without adding a build step.
- 2026-06-12 — `SETUP-ALINA.md` and `.claude/settings.local.json` added to `.gitignore`. — Private run-book and per-developer editor settings must not reach the public portfolio repo.
- 2026-06-12 — Server DB client isolated in `src/lib/db/client.ts` and guarded with the `server-only` package. — Makes any accidental import into a client bundle a build error, hard-enforcing Architecture Rule 1 (service key never reaches the browser).
- 2026-06-12 — All Supabase reads paginate via `.range()` over a stable `.order()`. — PostgREST caps a response at 1000 rows; demand_history (~3600 rows) was silently truncated, zeroing most products' demand stats. Pagination is correct regardless of the server cap.
- 2026-06-12 — Seed computes each product's safety stock / reorder point (via the domain layer) and sizes stock to force a deliberate status spread (3 critical, 5 reorder, rest OK). — A demo where everything is "OK" hides the reorder feature; reusing the domain math guarantees the seeded statuses are correct.
- 2026-06-12 — Data pages use `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`. — The sandbox data changes (edits, 24h reset), so pages must render per request rather than be statically cached.
- 2026-06-12 — `valueAtRisk(batches, horizon)` is cumulative (days ≤ horizon); in `getExpiryRisk` only future-expiring batches (days ≥ 0) are passed to it. — "Value at risk" means stock still at risk of expiring; already-expired inventory is sunk loss and shown in a separate "Already expired" KPI. The domain function remains general.
- 2026-06-12 — Demand stats use the sample standard deviation (n−1), 0 for fewer than two points. — Standard estimator for demand variability feeding safety stock and (Phase 2) z-score anomaly detection; the guard handles the single-/zero-point boundaries cleanly.
- 2026-06-13 — `suggestedOrderQty` rounds UP (Math.ceil) to the nearest pack size, not to nearest-integer. — Ordering a partial pack is not possible in practice; ceiling ensures the order clears the reorder point.

## Phase 2

- 2026-06-13 — Anomaly detection uses sample std dev (n−1), requires ≥14 datapoints, threshold |z| > 2.5, σ=0 guard returns []. — SPEC §F5 values; sample std dev is the correct estimator; 14-point minimum avoids false positives on sparse data; σ=0 guard prevents divide-by-zero on constant demand.
- 2026-06-13 — `hasRecentAnomaly` window is (asOfIso − 13 days) to asOfIso inclusive (14-day window). — Matches the SPEC "last 14 days" intent; the window is computed by date string comparison for simplicity.
- 2026-06-13 — `minDaysToExpiry` uses 9999 (not Infinity) as the sentinel for "no batches". — `JSON.stringify(Infinity)` produces `null`, which corrupts Next.js server-to-client serialisation; 9999 is safe and clearly means "no batch".
- 2026-06-13 — Briefing is generated via a React Server Action (`'use server'`). — Keeps all DB access on the server while giving the client a `useTransition` pending state with no extra API route needed.
- 2026-06-13 — Briefing VAR threshold set to 5,000 (SPEC §F4 value). — Threshold and the five rule definitions are the only magic numbers in the briefing module; all are documented in `briefing.ts` constants.
- 2026-06-13 — F6 chip state is stored in the URL search param `chip` via `useSearchParams` / `router.replace`. — Makes chip selection bookmarkable and shareable (SPEC §F6); lazy `useState` initializer reads the param on mount to avoid the `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` lint rule.
- 2026-06-13 — Product DELETE cascades in the route handler (demand_history → batches → products) rather than relying on DB foreign-key cascade. — The Supabase project was created without explicit ON DELETE CASCADE constraints; doing it in the route handler is safe and explicit.
- 2026-06-13 — `/api/admin/reset` re-implements the seed logic (same Mulberry32 PRNG, seed 0x50484152) rather than importing from `scripts/seed.ts`. — The seed script calls `dotenv/config` and uses a direct `createClient` call with a different env-load path; importing it into a route handler would fail at runtime. Duplication is the simpler and more correct choice here.
- 2026-06-13 — Zod used for request-body validation in all CRUD route handlers. — Concise schema definition with typed parse result; no extra dependency (already in the stack for type-safe validation at system boundaries).

## Phase 2 triage fixes

- 2026-06-13 — `/api/admin/reset` now exports GET (primary Vercel cron entry point) and keeps POST (manual). — Vercel Cron only issues GET; SPEC §F7 updated to match.
- 2026-06-13 — `ui.tsx` marked `'use client'` to enable useEffect/useId/useRef in the Dialog component. — Dialog needed Escape handler, focus restore, and ARIA ids; these require hooks, which require the client directive. All exports in ui.tsx are pure presentation with no server-only imports, so the change is safe.
- 2026-06-13 — `SortKey` extended with `valueAtRisk30d` and `minDaysToExpiry` for chip-driven sort. — The `top-var` and `expiring-60` chips advertise a specific ordering that requires sorting on computed fields not in the original sort key union.

## Phase 3

- 2026-06-13 — PWA icons use SVG only (no PNG). — Chrome 93+ and all modern browsers support SVG in the web manifest with `"purpose": "any"`; generating PNG binaries requires external tooling not warranted for a portfolio project.
- 2026-06-13 — OG image generated via `next/og` `ImageResponse` (`src/app/opengraph-image.tsx`). — Built-in Next.js App Router feature; zero new dependencies; generates a branded card for LinkedIn/social sharing at build time on the edge runtime.
- 2026-06-13 — CI workflow runs lint + typecheck + test only (no build step). — `npm run build` requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env secrets that are not available in CI without additional setup; the three code-quality gates catch errors reliably without needing a full production build.
- 2026-06-13 — Heartbeat cron (`heartbeat.yml`) pings `/api/health` every 3 days via a GitHub Actions scheduled workflow. — Supabase free-tier projects pause after 7 days of inactivity; a lightweight HTTP GET is enough to count as activity and is free to run in GitHub Actions. The `PRODUCTION_URL` repo variable is set by Alina during deployment; the workflow_dispatch trigger allows manual pings at any time.
